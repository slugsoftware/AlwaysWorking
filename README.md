# AlwaysWorking

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic situation, remote working has become more and more natural in our working landscape. In some cultures, being always available, ready to answer and proactive to address any crazy requirement from management is a must, so AlwaysWorking is a tool that helps you to show your commitment to your company. Be always available, with the green dot on your favourite instant messaging tool and ready to answer you manager's emails.
AlwaysWorking automatically moves the mouse cursor 1 pixel each certain period of time, so you won't appear no more as "Away" in your IM applications.
